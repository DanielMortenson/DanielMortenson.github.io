description: Predatory Swarm Simulator. Boid's Algorithm (Reynolds 1987) is the classical method for modeling the movement of animals in flocks or swarms. In it, each each bird-oid (boid) actor makes choices about how to move based on the movement of surrounding boids. In this report, I show that Boid's Algorithm can be extended to describe short-term predator-prey dynamics, where one or both of the groups (predator and prey) behave as flocks or swarms. Swarm-predator, swarm-prey behavior is most notably seen in sharks and schools of fish (shoiks and foish) and flocks of birds and flocks of insects.
