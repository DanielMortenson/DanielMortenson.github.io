description: Twitter contains massive amounts of social data. By analyzing the hashtags people use, we can place users into hashtag communities. After constructing a bipartite network of users and the hashtags they use, we perform a unipartite projection onto the hashtag set, giving us a network of hashtags that are connected if a user used both of them. Then, by using the Louvain Method for community detection, we can find communities of hashtags that are related in some meaningful way.
